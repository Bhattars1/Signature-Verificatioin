The Signature Verifier is a machine learning system designed to authenticate handwritten signatures and detect forgeries with minimal input. Using a single genuine signature image and one forged image (or more for higher accuracy), the system trains a deep learning model to perform reliable signature verification. Inspired by the research paper "An Offline Signature Verification and Forgery Detection Method Based on a Single Known Sample and an Explainable Deep Learning Approach", this project combines a unique local feature extraction method. It simplifies the setup process, making it accessible to anyone interested in biometric verification.

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt. Then, execute app.py to begin training the model, specifying the desired number of epochs. Training may take some time, depending on the dataset and system configuration. Once training is complete, use signature_verifier.py to verify whether a given signature is genuine or forged. The system offers flexibility, supporting multiple training samples for enhanced accuracy while maintaining ease of use.
